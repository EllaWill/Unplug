Lyrics

Comin' to ya, via CVS
All the code, that's safe to load
Got the ProPolice, in the GCC
Boundry checks, and Canaries

I'm a Source Fish, ha ha
Yeah I'm a Source Fish
I'm a Source Fish
Woah I'm a Source Fish

Code used to suck, in a Big way
But it Keeps getting better, each and every day
OpenSSL, wasn't done by us
With Libre ha ha, there ain't no fuss

I'm a Source Fish
Woah I'm a Source Fish
I'm a Source Fish
I'm a Source Fish

With a secure shell, and a key or two
You'd be amazed, at what I can do
OpenSSH, relayd, PF, OpenNTPd
All I am, has been used for free

I'm a Source Fish, that's right
I'm a Source Fish
I'm a Source Fish
Yeah I'm a Source Fish

When the bullies, in that neighborhood
Come collecting, just remember that I'm Free, I'm Free Yeah Yeah, I'm Free Yeah Yeah

Instrumental

I'm a Source Fish, ha
Yes I'm a Source Fish
You, over there You a Source Fish, ha ha
Yeah, I'm a Source Fish
Who that over there, He's a Source Fish, You a Source Fish, ha
I'm a Source Fish, Yeah Yeah
I'm a Source Fish, Yeah Yeah
Source Fish
